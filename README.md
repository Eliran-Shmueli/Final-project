### <div align="center">Final Project</div>  
  

The main objective of this project was to recognize emotion in real time with a camera by using machine learning (CNN and SVM models) in Python.
<br />
The emotions that we tried to detect are: happy, neutral, surprise, angry, fear and sad.
<br />
Because some emotions are closer to one another, we decided to divide the emotions into two groups:
- Positive: happy, neutral and surprise.
- Negative: angry, fear and sad.
<br />
When detected, the emotions will be displayed on the user's screen as follows:

- No face detected: blue frame.
- Positive emotion: green text and frame. 
- Negative emotion: red text and frame.
